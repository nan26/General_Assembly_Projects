Any hacks for car Bluetooth?,"Hello, I am curious if anyone has figured out a workaround to get Apple Watch audio over car Bluetooth?

Apple Watch vs other fitness trackers (and a couple other questions),"Hello, I‚Äôm about to begin getting serious with working out, and I‚Äôm in the market for a fitness tracker to monitor things including, but not limited to; heart rate, heart rate irregularities, steps, and distance traveled.

Apple Watch SE6 back glass shattered and cut wrist! Not impact resistant and unsafe.,"I got my Apple Watch SE6 in Jan 2021. Since it's the latest ""SE6"" version and specifically designed for ""Fitness and Sports"", I wear it to track all my physical activities.

Last weekend (March 5, 2021) I was snowboarding in Utah, with the ""snowboarding mode"" on. I took a small side hit jump and landed without falling. However, during the landing, my left wrist with the watch was squeezed in-between my chest and thigh, and somehow I felt a little pain on my wrist. I looked at the watch and it was still functioning and intact. Therefore, I did not pay attention and thought it was just a squeeze due to pressure.

However, at the end of the day, the pain seemed to grow so I took off the watch. Surprisingly, I found the back of the watch completely shattered, with glass pieces inside my skin. I could not believe Apple does not use an impact-resistant glass that can withstand accidental force without shattering into pieces, like GoPro. I mean, the watch was under normal usage, the impact was not even that big, the front of the watch was completely intact, and the watch was still functioning fine.

Even if I get a replacement, this could happen again, not only to me but to anyone. I called Apple customer care but the engineers responded that this is a rare case, and all they could do is to repair it. I really hope Apple can improve the design or change the type of material to protect the users. 

My point is, the incident is strange that only the back of the watch shattered, while the watch is still functioning and intact. If the impact was that big, shouldn't the front side be broken/cracked as well? As I mentioned, I did not even fall or hit anything hard. The watch was likely squeezed in between my body and broke? I just hear everyone's opinion and understand how this could happen :)

As attached images, I am not sure if it'll be helpful to get a protective case when you wear AppleWatch for any physical activities to prevent potential injury to your wrist.

These complications mysteriously stopped working on my watch - for example, when I play music from Spotify, it doesn‚Äôt show that on my watch: https://imgur.com/a/CHEf7GR, nor can I browse my Spotify library, which I was able to do up until now.

I am able to open these complications on my watch and they all appear in my Arrangement: https://imgur.com/a/CeLsIXq
They simply just don‚Äôt work the same way they used to, and they are not syncing content onto my iPhone anymore. 

I am a bit afraid of unpairing and pairing my watch again as I heard that in rare cases you can lose content and data that was created by your watch, but I have tried all the general fixes I could find online that are supposed to help like turning both devices on and off, reinstalling the apps in question on my iPhone, etc.

Any advice will be much appreciated!",1,complication malfunctioning problem recently complication apple watch seem check watch app iphone look though installed try install work illustrated video complication mysteriously stopped working watch example play music spotify show watch browse spotify library able able open complication watch appear arrangement simply work way used syncing content onto iphone anymore bit afraid unpairing pairing watch heard rare case lose content data created watch tried general fix could find online supposed help like turning device reinstalling apps question iphone etc advice much appreciated,588

Mu evolution with Apple Watch,"Most people think of Apple Watch as a companion device to the iPhone. For me though, that mode of thinking and use has flipped. I view and use the Apple Watch as my core daily information/communications device and my iPhone more as a support device (like one might think of a router) for my Apple Watch.

Chief among the advantages of this for me is the fact that I no longer carry my iPhone around with me at home and while out. I have always been one of those people who liked to travel light. I hate having a bunch of crap in my pockets, change, keys, wallet, cell phone - all weighty annoyances, especially in summer time (which is fast approaching now where I live in South Carolina).

I also now no longer feel the need to upgrade my iPhone so often. For years I upgraded every other model year to keep decent performance and a state of the art device. I just recently passed the four year mark with my iPhone 7 and was both pleased and surprised to realize I am still very happy with it, feeling absolutely no desire to upgrade at this time. I really use it very little now.

My journey to this change of mindset began about 6 years with a Series 0 Apple Watch purchased via Craigslist. Since that time I have owned every model, series 1,2,3,4 and 5 (not the six though since I‚Äôm waiting to see w hat design changes may come with this falls Series 7.) I purchased a spanking new launch day Series 3 LTE watch directly from Apple 3 years ago, and because of the enhanced screen size, 64bit processor and other features like Fall Detection and ECG capabilities - went ahead and upgraded to a 44mm Series 4 LTE from Apple as well. Last year I sold the S4 and purchased a flawless condition S5 from Craigslist.

The early non-cellular versions were useful to me in most of the traditional ways people find Apple Watch useful. My case is a bit unique as I retired quite early and now live on a large lot on a lake. Whether out with the dogs or doing yard work, lounging at the shoreline - my personal quirk of not wanting to carry a whole load of crap in my pockets - the Apple Watch had been a useful companion that allowed me to keep in touch, receive and send messages and emails the whole time - albeit within the range of wifi coverage.

Beginning with my Series 3 LTE, a connection to Verizon allowed me to venture into town as well sans iPhone. I had to invest in a pair of AirPods to allow private conversations and to be able to listen to music when desired. The series 4 and series 5 have been, performance and antenna wise, a great improvement over the S3.

At times I have also owned two cellular Series 4/5‚Äôs. This has allowed me never to worry about battery charging issues, even while using cellular. I plan to buy the Series 7 when available and keep the S5 as my backup (and while charging) device.

I‚Äôm sure my journey with Apple Watch will continue...",1,mu evolution apple watch people think apple watch companion device iphone though mode thinking use flipped view use apple watch core daily information communication device iphone support device like one might think router apple watch chief among advantage fact longer carry iphone around home always one people liked travel light hate bunch crap pocket change key wallet cell phone weighty annoyance especially summer time fast approaching live south carolina also longer feel need upgrade iphone often year upgraded every model year keep decent performance state art device recently passed four year mark iphone pleased surprised realize still happy feeling absolutely desire upgrade time really use little journey change mindset began year series apple watch purchased via craigslist since time owned every model series six though since waiting see w hat design change may come fall series purchased spanking new launch day series lte watch directly apple year ago enhanced screen size bit processor feature like fall detection ecg capability went ahead upgraded mm series lte apple well last year sold purchased flawless condition craigslist early non cellular version useful traditional way people find apple watch useful case bit unique retired quite early live large lot lake whether dog yard work lounging shoreline personal quirk wanting carry whole load crap pocket apple watch useful companion allowed keep touch receive send message email whole time albeit within range wifi coverage beginning series lte connection verizon allowed venture town well sans iphone invest pair airpods allow private conversation able listen music desired series series performance antenna wise great improvement time also owned two cellular series allowed never worry battery charging issue even using cellular plan buy series available keep backup charging device sure journey apple watch continue,1889

Best way to track workout calories without watch on?,"Hey everyone, so I play netball and you aren‚Äôt allowed to wear watches while playing. I have purchased a chest strap heart rate monitor (Polar H10) which is really good, and it is more consistent at tracking your heart rate.

 Today I am just trying to figure out what works best. I have turned off wrist detection and done a trial of a AW workout Run, and also Basketball however even with heart rate data I‚Äôm not sure if the calories / ‚Äòmove‚Äô contribution is based on anything other than time from when the workout started.

My Review Of The Apple Watch Series 6 Lte Coming From a Galaxy Watch 3," 

Why? 

1. I Had the Opportunity to go to apple land 
2. I wanted Lte  
3. I wanted to limit the Options I had, so as to be able to focus on other meaningful stuff 

My Exprience With Smart Watches  

My Experience has been Limited, I have only Had the Chance to Use 

* A Galaxy Watch Active Black 
* A Galaxy Watch 3 51mm BT 
* Apple Watch Series 6 Lte 

So as you can see My experience With Smart Watches Has Been Limited 

What I Like About My Apple Watch Series 6 

Faces: Many Of You will Burn me Down for saying this but I'm gonnq say this anyway, I Love the faces in AW6, all of them are very customizable to varing degrees. And I Don't have to search for good faces every Damn Day. and Some of the Faces in the Galaxy Store are Just HORRIBLE 

Fitness: I'm actually not Very Concerned about fitness much but the awards and the live rings on watch faces are more Motivating then the lines on the health Dasboard watch face. 

We'll get to the Fitness Aspect Later 

Apps: Man the Aw6 has goood App Support MILES BETTER THAN GALAXY WATCHES and Half the Apps on Galaxy Store are meh. 

I Can Have My Todoist Task on my Watch face 

I even can Have My Schedule On Any face I want. 

Voice Assistant: I Know Many of You will Kill me for writing this but, Siri is so much better then Bixby, it has so much faster Voice recognition and is just Quick. 

Another win is being able to change Watch face by just a swipe 

What I Hate About My Apple Watch Series 6 

Battery: It's Just Bad, just Lasts a day, My GW3 lasted for 2.5 Days 

Fitness: I Think the sensors on this Watch are highly incorrect, I now burn a billion calories now, and heart rate is also incorrect 

Sleep Tracking: It's Bad But I only use it some times I Don't want somthing on my arm when I'm Half Naked 

AND WHY IN HELL CAN'T I USE ON BOARD SPEAKERS TO PLAY MUSIC, I MEAN THEY ARE THERE FOR A REASON",1,review apple watch series lte coming galaxy watch opportunity go apple land wanted lte wanted limit option able focus meaningful stuff exprience smart watch experience limited chance use galaxy watch active black galaxy watch mm bt apple watch series lte see experience smart watch limited like apple watch series face many burn saying gonnq say anyway love face aw customizable varing degree search good face every damn day face galaxy store horrible fitness actually concerned fitness much award live ring watch face motivating line health dasboard watch face get fitness aspect later apps man aw goood app support mile better galaxy watch half apps galaxy store meh todoist task watch face even schedule face want voice assistant know many kill writing siri much better bixby much faster voice recognition quick another win able change watch face swipe hate apple watch series battery bad last day gw lasted day fitness think sensor watch highly incorrect burn billion calorie heart rate also incorrect sleep tracking bad use time want somthing arm half naked hell use board speaker play music mean reason,1108
Apple Watch - to cut back on phone usage?,"I‚Äôm hopelessly addicted to my phone and all of these stupid little apps. I‚Äôm particularly bad with Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. 

I am really considering ditching a smartphone altogether and was going to go with those intentionally-dumb-smartphones like light-phone II or palm. The only thing is I‚Äôm so entrenched in the ecosystem (damn you apple) that I still value iMessage, Apple podcasts, my AirPods, and all that jazz. 

I know that Apple Watch can be used more separately from the phone than it has been able to in the past, but are we at the point yet where I can leave my phone in a drawer at home and hit the town with just my watch and have everything the watch is able to do function correctly?

Issues with syncing paid for podcasts to watch.,"(Apple Watch SE - non cellular)

Like a lot of you I assume, I use my watch to play music or podcasts when I run and workout. 

Although I don‚Äôt think the process of adding podcasts is very good, it‚Äôs generally been ok for me. The only issue is my favourite and most listened to podcast is one that I pay for, and therefore it is password protected. 

On my iPhone it‚Äôs absolutely fine after giving it the password and it updates as each new episode comes out. Occasionally it‚Äôs asks me for the password, but then suddenly loads the episodes without it. 

However on my Apple Watch these shows never sync or appear. Every other (free) podcast updates absolutely fine, aside from the one I actually pay for! 

I leave my phone at home when I run so it‚Äôs very frustrating to have to listen to one of my secondary podcasts when I‚Äôm out for a few hours. Especially as with this podcast the episodes become out of date very quickly (sports) 

Any idea if I‚Äôm doing something wrong?

Using my 40mm Series 6 watch w/ Strava for long bike rides (70+ miles),"I've been using the Strava app on my watch for all my rides, and it's been working fine for that purpose. It's worked up to 40 miles or so with no issue (these rides are less than 4 hours). I'm planning on doing a much longer ride in the future, and would benefit greatly from the heart sensor data, but I'm worried that the battery will give out before I finish. I had the following questions:

1. During these bike rides, I will not use the phone &lt;-&gt; watch pairing whatsoever (for notifications, calls, etc.). Would I get a significant amount of extra charge by turning off bluetooth and turning on airplane mode on the watch? I'll still want to use the GPS (for Strava) and heartbeat measurements.
2. The battery issue may also be a Strava thing. Has anyone had a better experience by using the built-in fitness app to start an outdoor ride, and then exporting this to Strava (rather than using the Strava app)? My thinking would be that it would be a bit more optimized.
3. This is more out there, but worst case, I feel like I can bring a battery pack and charger with me, and while I'm stopping for lunch somewhere, take off my watch and charge it a bit. My worry here is the fitness app/Strava will finish the activity.

Dealing with an injury,"I'm wondering if the Watch can deal with me dealing with an injury and recovery or am I just SOL til I get better.

A year ago I sought treatment for pain in my R knee. During the weeks of physical therapy, I was advised to and started a walking regimen, as I'd let my exercise completely slip prior to the injury.

From March-May I very slowly built up distance and stamina, and bought my Apple Watch to be able to be out without my phone. Side benefit: by July I could almost sing along with the entirety of Hamilton when it came out on Disney+! I felt great and got more fit, saw improvement in VO2Max, heart rate, etc. Good times.

Then, in mid-August, the L knee just exploded in pain. MRI this time; torn meniscus and cartilage. Went from 3 miles/day to barely getting around the house. I probably had a torn R meniscus all this time, but it hadn't been imaged. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø We did a steroid shot which was awesome for 2 months, but it wore off in half the time. I felt much worse so the doc said no more of that. So now I am on a wait list for arthroscopic surgery, and in the meantime, undergoing my 3rd round of PT. Argh.

About 3-4x/week, I can manage a 20--40 minute walk with my dog (definitely not a fitness pace, more like a stroll + lots of stopping/standing). Of course my exercise ring is not picking up anything anymore. I realize my fitness level has gone down, but can't the watch help you by adjusting to your worse level? I read in another thread about re-calibrating. Is this something I can do and not lose any of my previous data, and then do it again in the future when I am hopefully back on my feet in a more regular way?

Thanks for reading.

My theory on AW6/SE tracking stand hours,"My theory:

Apple Watch (series 6, SE) uses the always on altimeter and uses smart processing to see the altitude of your sitting position (looks at how long you‚Äôve stayed that altitude, automatically assumes you‚Äôre sitting) then when you stand, it changes the alt and it starts counting stand minutes.

Sometimes the data might not be accurate. For example, you waiting in a long line. Apple Watch might think you‚Äôre sitting but in reality you‚Äôre just standing for a long time. 

Again, this is just my weird theory I just made up.

Issues with Activity App syncing to iPhone,"Hi everyone,

Over the last couple of days I've been having issues with my activity rings in the activity app syncing with my iPhone. I've tried repairing the watch, keeping it close to the phone while both are on charge, restarting both the watch and the phone... both the watch and phone are fully up to date in terms of software.

It took a day and a half for Friday's activity and most of yesterday's to sync, and then today it stopped syncing after a few hours. I use the data from the activity app for lots of other apps so it's really frustrating!

PSA. Not sure if this has been mentioned recently but I can‚Äôt recommend the Series 3.,"My grandfather wanted an Apple Watch and he recently got the S3 wanting the cheapest version available. I figured ok well he barely uses any apps and it would help keep track of his calories burned, track time and heart rate etc. so after he‚Äôd visit my house over a few months on/off I‚Äôd have a hard time updating his watch due to the abysmal 8GB of storage for the GPS model. I‚Äôd get lucky at times after a reboot or a simple settings reset but the watch has a hard time and even then the performance is laggy and slow so not very convenient. 

I know the $199/$229 starting price sounds good but when the SE starts at only $80 more it really is a bad deal.

Sometimes the tiny changes by Apple are a major inconvenience.,"Before WatchOS 7 I was able to set an app to run indefinitely. This is extremely important for me since I have Type 1 diabetes and use the Dexcom app to display my glucose values on my watch. The update to os7 introduced a subtle change where the return to clock setting of ""Never"" was instead replaced with ""After 1 hour"". This means that the Dexcom app will close and instead show my watch face at least every hour. I know that there's a complication for Dexcom but it is rarely updated, which is why leaving the app running as a watch face always showed the most recent glucose value. This is just one of those cases where Apple probably thought it wasn't a big deal and most people want to see their watch face instead of an app anyway but overlooked people like me that relied on being able to glance at my watch and Only ever see Dexcom. 
Does anyone know how to downgrade a watch OS?

Got a crazy Apple Watch story,"So I‚Äôve always been a mechanical guy wearing Rolex , Cartier , Omega and other brands everyday . When the Apple Watch series 0 came out I bought it immediately because I thought it was gonna become a milestone watch .

Fast forward to 2021 it did. Easily on the the top 50 most influential watches of all time .

I bought S Steel Milanese version back in 2015 because it was the one I could afford. I wanted the eddition or the linked version.  After a while sold it because I was not using it ..

2 months ago I see an ad on the local Craigslist equivalent for an Apple Watch original for only 150‚Ç¨. Box papers and cables included. I call him buy it the same day without blinking. 

It was a gorgeous Series 0 with Link steel bracelet and absolutely great battery. Wore it a couple of days ... thinking it will be shit .

Fell in love again with this stupid smart watch . Ditched the Rolex back into the safe ..

1 week ago after my experience with the 0 decided to buy a series 5 used ..
Contemplated between the titanium , the ceramic or the same S Steel as the one I‚Äôve always had .

Saw a guy on eBay selling the titanium for 350$ used .. decent but then he put a Steel for $280 .. i clicked immediately.. ‚Ç¨100 shipping to Europe though DAYMM

Got  it to day the idiot sent me Herm√®s one üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ!!!!

Seller from New York If you are reading this sorry I ain‚Äôt returning your Herm√®s. üòÇ If you want it back come get it here in Switzerland...

My Apple Watch Se review,"I'm a geek so it doesn't take much for me to buy new technology. However I waited a while to get an Apple Watch.  My first smartwatch buy was an inexpensive FITVII last August.  I wanted to see what these smartwatch things were about, what they can do for me, and if I can wear one all day without breaking something.

The FITVII proved to be useful and rugged.  Since I'm recently retired it helped remind me to improve my steps.  It let me reject phone calls if my iPhone wasn't handy (you can accept a call on the FITVII but there's no microphone.)  I could check my heart rate and sleep patterns.  It synced data with the Health app.

After a few months of that success I decided to go for an Apple watch, so I bought an SE in January.  I didn't know what I was missing before and I enjoyed the many new features.  I could actually answer a phone call on the watch when I was out walking the dog and I forgot my iPhone.  I get more reminders for standing and moving.  I can use Siri without getting the phone.  It's even a plus with directions in CarPlay - it will vibrate and make the sound of signaling when it's time to signal a turn.

With Fitness+ I can watch my heart rate and make sure I'm not pushing it too much.  And as a side review, Fitness+ is fine for us older and out of shape guys. I use the beginner exercises and they don't overwork you. I also substitute moves if I think I can't handle them.

I'm looking forward to more watch technology and the SE is a great start.

Miscellaneous notes:

I had eye strain for a while after first getting the watch.  I wear glasses that range from slightly magnified in the middle to bifocals at the bottom.  My eyes are fine now but I had to learn the best positions for reading the small text.

The watch band fits me ok.  I have it on the third hole from the end. What I really need is another hole between the second and third.  I'll check into a different strap sometime.

I thought battery charging would be a pain (the FITVII went about 4 days on a charge), but the SE is good.

We are thinking of a few interesting apps for the watch but it‚Äôs unclear if Apple allow some functionalities. Will be happy to know if one of these available:

2. Showing a notification from an app with multiple buttons for selection, so the alert can ask something and the user click one of X options to close the notification ( like snooze/off-but with custom options)

3. App will wake up when heart rate is higher than x, then app will do something in background.

4. Constantly reading and analyzing gyro/accelerometer?

I just picked up an SE, and I've noticed something about battery health. Hoping somebody could either corroborate my theory, or tell me if I have a defective device.  


If I charge my watch overnight, it appears that the watch drains somewhat faster. It's currently 10:30 AM and I'm already at 83%.

  
Yesterday and the day before, I charged it over night, went for a run in the morning, then threw it back on the charger for 15-20 mins, which charged it back up to 100%. Yesterday I 10:30, I still have around 95% battery.  


Is there anything to this? When you charge the watch overnight, does it actually stop charging at 100% in the middle of the night and then lose a little juice? By charging it again after my run, did I truly charge it to 100%?   


Let me know if anybody thinks this makes sense lol.",1,observation battery draining curious anybody else experience hello picked se noticed something battery health hoping somebody could either corroborate theory tell defective device charge watch overnight appears watch drain somewhat faster currently already yesterday day charged night went run morning threw back charger min charged back yesterday still around battery anything charge watch overnight actually stop charging middle night lose little juice charging run truly charge let know anybody think make sense lol,518

"My apple watch spent 24 hours 19 feet below the surface of Lake Superior, and survived","This is the story of how my apple watch survived frigid and turbulent waters for over 24 hours, and was working when recovered.

My girlfriend and I had taken a trip last summer to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan during the early stages of our relationship to learn more about each other. We had an amazing time, but one of the days we decided to go cliff diving at black rocks in Marquette, Michigan. The drop from black rocks is about 20 feet until you hit the water, and the bottom is 19-22 feet below the surface. In my carelessness i had left my series 4 on my wrist when she and I jumped and had a friend we met there film it. We jumped a few times, then got back to the truck because the lake temp is only in the 50‚Äôs on a good day. Once we got to the bar later she noticed my watch was missing, i panicked and after searching the truck we watched the video of our cliff dive and realized it had fallen off.

Fast forward to the next day we went on a kayak trip and somehow the idea got in my head that i could dive down and get it. So about 24 hours later as the sun was setting again we got to black rocks. I borrowed a pair of children‚Äôs goggles and jumped in to search. The water there is frigid, about 50‚Äô on the surface and so close to freezing at the bottom the massive boulders feel like slippery ice cubes. I dove down about 5-6 times in the approximate location of where i lost it, but the visibility was terrible in the goggles. I came up after my last dive, to get ready for the next when the guy i borrowed the goggles from offered to switch with me in the search for a bit. For context they say if you stay in lake superior for more than 10 minutes you‚Äôll get hypothermia, at that point i had been in for almost 17 minutes. So we traded places. On the third dive down as my girlfriend was warming me up our new friend came up with a black object in his right hand. He had found the watch! As he brought it up and i fought off the early stages of hypothermia he came walked towards me. For context i had previously offered anyone who found it $50 if it was broken, and $100 if it was working. When he got close to me i asked him if it was working and he replied ‚Äúwell, were you listening to led zeppelin?‚Äù. Not only was it working, but it still had a 43% charge from over 48 hours since its last. I was amazed that it survived that long in that deep of water. The guy who found it out of the kindness of his heart refused my money.

To this day i still have that watch, and it still works perfectly fine!

Tl;dr: dropped my watch 19 feet or more down in lake superior and it spent 24 hours down there. Went back for it and found it, and it was still working.

Did I get given a correct repair quote? [UK],"I have a 40mm S6 watch. I dropped it and the screen got a massive scrape, as well as the casing surrounding the screen getting many scratches that exposed the unpainted metal. 

As it was so new, I decided to see how much it would cost to repair. Contacted Apple support and used their live chat option. I got a very helpful advisor who advised me that the price would be ¬£286.44. Steep but fair enough since I don‚Äôt have AppleCare+. I lost connection near the end so I got an email through with a link to pay to complete the repair request. 

However, it said I had to pay ¬£386.44, not ¬£286.44. I assumed this was a typo so got back on to live chat and explained the issue. I was told that I was quoted the incorrect price by the first advisor and that ¬£286.44 was only for a screen replacement, that the casing is extra and then tax on top of that. 

I immediately balked at this as I paid ¬£329 for the watch brand new. I declined to go forward for the repair as it was illogical - I could just buy a new watch and save money. 

My question is, was the second advisor correct? I had a look at the pricing list on apple‚Äôs website and I couldn‚Äôt see anything that meant adding to the ¬£286.44 - it seems to be a flat fee?

1. Does it not track sleep stages? It seems like it doesn't track sleep stages? Aforementioned partner would like it to break down stages like REM sleep, light sleep, deep sleep.. but from screenshots we've seen it looks like it only does total sleep time?
2. How much battery life does it lose overnight?
3. Is there any difference between the different models of AW? Do the improved sensors on the Series 6 lead to better tracking over the SE?
4. If there is deeper functionality is some of it locked behind the new health subscription? My partner may be thinking about getting that anyway.",1,apple watch sleep tracking someone give rundown usually android person partner firmly camp iphone getting jealous sleep tracking samsung watch considering apple watch match however looking seems bit lacking question track sleep stage seems like track sleep stage aforementioned partner would like break stage like rem sleep light sleep deep sleep screenshots seen look like total sleep time much battery life lose overnight difference different model aw improved sensor series lead better tracking se deeper functionality locked behind new health subscription partner may thinking getting anyway,595

Handwashing reminder going haywire,"In the last few weeks or so the handwashing reminder has been firing off at nonsensical times. It seems to detect when I arrive home and correctly displays it then (at least that's my current assumption), but I might also wake up in the morning to notice that the watch has a few hours old notification reminding me to wash my hands. I usually let the watch charge through the whole night, so there is no conceivable reason why it should display the reminder since the watch has been on charger the whole time.

Has anyone else come across this? I'm using AW 6 Cellular.

Edit.

A small correction is in place. I was just running some errands and returned home, and noticed that I haven't received any handwashing reminder. It's been an hour or so that I returned home.

Questions about Apple Watch Capabilities from a Fitbit user looking to switch,"Hi all! I‚Äôm considering upgrading my Fitbit Charge 2 to an Apple Watch. I just have some questions about the Apple Watch 6 that I haven‚Äôt found answers to online.

Is the Apple Watch App itself just meant to control what is on the watch and how it functions, or is it more like Fitbit‚Äôs accompanying app (where you can see all the stat breakdowns and add your own notes on a bigger screen)?  
Are things broken down/explained nicely and pretty easy to understand and navigate on both the app and the watch? I tend to like things that are simple and easy to use because of my adhd.

With the Apple Watch, would I be able to track long-term progress like weight loss? Particularly, is it possible to edit your fitness history (ie adding my weight loss progress from past years?)

Are you Apple Watch users pretty satisfied with its sleep tracking capabilities? Does the Apple Watch show the different sleep cycles and how much time spent in each? Does it show sleep tracking history for longer than a week?

Does it connect well with MyFitnessPal and Spotify like they say it does? 

Also, if anyone out there has used both Fitbit and Apple Watch before I‚Äôd love your input and opinion on both, or any other info that might help!

"Anyone noticed a distinct increase in workout minutes despite not doing more? (Series 3, 38 mm)","I've had an an apple watch for several years so I come to this issue with a decent bit of experience. In the last few days, I've noticed my watch is registering a lot more workout minutes than normal. For example, today I already have 12 minutes and I've done nothing that in my mind would (or, more importantly, has in the past) earned a single workout minute. I've been noticing this issue since Sunday.

I thought visual might help show this problem. Here's a random weekday last week (I did a workout at noon):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y9d47724qnk61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b076f8b29c5d36482b84bb59fa1348c593e264bd

Notice the lack of any exercise minutes outside of my actual workout. Actual workout that day was around 50 minutes. Some of the time afterward was probably just cooling down.

&amp;#x200B;

Compare that to yesterday when I did a workout in the afternoon. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zxsij9x4qnk61.png?width=1085&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74b332251233fb471ee391fd9a07067402fad8a6

Actual workout on this day was 65 minutes. 

So last week I registered 17ish extra beyond my workout and yesterday I registered 36. That seems minor but it's definitely a pattern in the last few days. 

Both days were work days and would have had my actions be very similar during the not-working out time (i.e., I have a desk job). Yesterday in particular - I know that I did nothing extraordinary. The only thing I can think that would have even registered yesterday was a grocery store trip - with a bit of walking . Otherwise, I'm at my desk.

I have not changed any settings and it's been a few weeks since I updated my watch IIRC (did it within a few days of the new update being pushed out) but this problem has only been happening for a few days.

"Thoughts on 1000+ calories/day move goal experience, lmk your thoughts and strategies too!","Got my watch in June of last year. That was back in the day when they used to give you new recommended goals each week based on your last week's performance. I'm guessing they killed that (unfortunately) because the goals just got crazier and crazier. BUT one big benefit was I quickly found a great goal to challenge myself--1130 calories--and actually was able to do it for six months until last week when I had a sore hamstring from a long run and just clearly needed to give it a rest. It's actually a bit liberating because I think I was overindexed on the goal, and my new approach is to hit it 6/7 days and take one day as a lighter day to let myself recuperate. 

Few more thoughts from the experience:

* It may seem like a high number to some (or a low number to others) and obviously there are so many factors that go into making it easier or harder for people, but it's actually in line with the recent guidance about fitness to try to hit 5k calories/week. Just goes a little over the top of that since I'm trying to really build out my cardio.
* As fun as it was to do it for that long, I'm just as thrilled to do 6/7 days. Really wish Apple supported rest days--not like total days off but at least days where your goal was 50% or something. Obviously it's all just fake numbers and fake goals and whatnot, but I do feel like Apple's unilateral approach to goals and streaks is pretty far out of line with expert guidance at this point, which is somewhat striking compared to, e.g., Fitness+ which really seems focused on getting good fundamentals and lessons across.
* For me mixing it up has been huge! Between running, cycling, playing Beat Saber, skating, it really was the key to not just have one activity I was doing every day. Some live for the grind of 5+ miles of jogging every day, but not I! :D (As much as I do love jogging.)",1,thought calorie day move goal experience lmk thought strategy got watch june last year back day used give new recommended goal week based last week performance guessing killed unfortunately goal got crazier crazier one big benefit quickly found great goal challenge calorie actually able six month last week sore hamstring long run clearly needed give rest actually bit liberating think overindexed goal new approach hit day take one day lighter day let recuperate thought experience may seem like high number low number others obviously many factor go making easier harder people actually line recent guidance fitness try hit k calorie week go little top since trying really build cardio fun long thrilled day really wish apple supported rest day like total day least day goal something obviously fake number fake goal whatnot feel like apple unilateral approach goal streak pretty far line expert guidance point somewhat striking compared e g fitness really seems focused getting good fundamental lesson across mixing huge running cycling playing beat saber skating really key one activity every day live grind mile jogging every day much love jogging,1153

Issue with Apple Watch storage constantly filling up.,"Hello,

I'm having an issue with my wife's Apple Watch Series 1 and was hoping someone here may be able to help me as my 2 attempts at Apple support helping me has not solved anything thus far. What happens is that the watch's internal storage get's completely full with who knows what. I've checked to see what is using up the space, but when I add everything up that's taking up space together I get less than 200MB used, and because the watch's storage is full it then starts not working properly (like not being able to erase messages, silence alarms, and constantly getting a warning that says the storage is full...etc). I've tried so many things to try and remedy this...including,

* Factory resetting the Apple Watch and then setting it up as a new device on her iPhone XS.
* Checking that her phone is not syncing over any photos, music, and other, and also making sure it only has the default Apple Watch apps installed on it.
* Resetting her iPhone, Resetting the watch, and then setting up both the iPhone and Apple Watch as new devices.
* Getting a brand new iPhone 12 Pro (don't worry she wanted to get one anyways, lol) and setting that up and then setting up the Apple Watch as a new device while also doing point 2 above.
* Checking her iCloud storage and wiping anything that we think would maybe upload to the watch (iMessage, reminders, etc).
* Signing out of iCloud on all her Apple devices, and then signing back into iCloud on all her devices.
* Restarting the Phone and Watch multiple times.
* Bring it into the Apple Store and have them run a diagnostics on it only for everything to be ""fine"".

I've even tried to sync her Apple Watch to my iPhone and magically this **DID** fix the issue. Attached to my iPhone it no longer syncs a bunch of random stuff and no longer gets full. So that rules it out being an issue with the Watch's hardware. 

I've also tried syncing my Apple Watch on her iPhone and it **WILL** do the same completely filling up of the storage capacity. Lastly I've wiped her old iPhone XS (as she now has a brand new iPhone 12 Pro) and set that up as a new device, logged into it with **MY** apple id, synced the Apple Watch and it worked fine. No syncing weirdness filling up the watch. 

This makes me think that the issue maybe has to do with her iCloud account. But like I've already stated...I've cleared most it out except Phone backups, photos (which I don't sync to the watch), and her safari bookmarks and such. I'm not sure what else to try or what to do, was hoping someone here maybe could help me out. Maybe I missed trying something? Maybe you've had a similar issue and were able to resolve it. Please help, would really appreciate getting this darn watch working again.

Experience with apple support and apple watch?,"So a few weeks ago I buy apple care + for my new watch.

Then, I am told by three different advisors that if I bring my watch to the store, it can be replaced then and there.

"Was gifted a Series 2, kinda like it and thinking of updating. What to replace with Series 5/6 or SE?","Was helping my Dad this weekend resize and re-band some of his dress watches, he opens a desk drawer and gives me an Apple Watch Series 2 that he got as a gift from an Ex, never wears it. 

Got it charged, removed from his account and paired to my iPhone 12 Pro. Yay.

I've been wearing a Garmin Fenix 5s for a couple years now and it's been everything I've wanted in a smartwatch. Had no desire for an Apple Watch... until of course I was gifted one. I get it now, the integration is just that much better ""It just works""...

Ok, as part of helping resize watch bands Dad also hands me a TAG Aquaracer and Ball Inspector and asks me to sell them. Anything over X I get to keep. Sold the TAG today and made $200 so I'm close to potentially being able to buy a newer Apple Watch. 

If the Series 2 would be getting the 'facemask unlock' feature I wouldn't consider an update but because it doesnt that seems like a worthwhile reason to update, in addition to all the other new features. But what model to get? Certainly the Series 6 would be the best option but does a used 5 make sense or would an SE be the way to go? Seems to me that the SE is somewhat crippled and buying that over a 5 or 6 is wasted money?

Now that I‚Äôm in the Apple space, I have been feeling like I need to update my smart watch and I‚Äôm very interested in the Apple Watch.

I mainly want my watch to be able to help me track my workouts, I mainly do powerlifting 4-5 times a week, and maybe a day of cardio. Besides that, I‚Äôd like a step tracker and maybe sleep tracker.

Anyway, do you think it‚Äôs worth it for me to upgrade? If yes, should I get the 6 or SE?

Apple Watch S3 counting steps while sleeping or not moving,"Hi! It's been three days since I bought my Apple Watch S3, and I've been impressed with it.

However, today I've noticed it counts some steps when I'm sleeping or in bed. For example, I've just seen that as I woke up now, it counted some steps, and even after I woke up without getting up from bed (just before I began writing here), it measured 30 steps. It's nothing too crazy, but it disappointed me anyway, given the price I paid for it.

I didn't calibrate it by walking 20 minutes on a walking exercise outdoor, as I've read on the Apple website. I'm just wondering if this calibration works or if the Apple Watch really counts some steps when sleeping. 

Thanks! :)",1,apple watch counting step sleeping moving hi three day since bought apple watch impressed however today noticed count step sleeping bed example seen woke counted step even woke without getting bed began writing measured step nothing crazy disappointed anyway given price paid calibrate walking minute walking exercise outdoor read apple website wondering calibration work apple watch really count step sleeping thanks,417

TRANSPARENT APPLE WATCH??? Might just happen,"Hey guys üëã

While in college, I‚Äôve been doing glass replacements and screen repairs for apple watches. This helped me become knowledgeable of how the devices work, how to disassemble and assemble them completely, etc.

One thing that came to mind the other day was making transparent Apple Watches out of hard silicone. Of course the display and the backplate won‚Äôt be transparent however the casing will. The devices will remain water-resistant

It is a very difficult process, I want to gauge customer interest to see if it is something worth doing and if people are willing to pay for this. Please help me out by choosing one of the options, it will determine if this is something I should dive into. 

I am thinking about pricing them $200-$250 above current used device prices.

I would love any thought or feedback regarding the idea!

Why can't we calibrate apple watch walk/run workouts using a treadmill?,"Basically, at the gym, when I do an indoor walk workout on the treadmill, when the treadmill reads 1 mile (which should be perfectly accurate considering the known length of the belt), my watch is only at about 0.8 miles. Obviously this makes any pace measurements and comparisons kinda useless.

The official way to calibrate your indoor walk/run stride is to do an OUTDOOR run or walk in a flat area with good GPS reception for at least 20 minutes - then it'll learn how far you move in how many steps. Makes sense - but some of us live where it's very cold and hilly. I have a gym membership specifically to work out inside. Why isn't there an option to like, say, force touch the screen of the Workout app at the moment that the treadmill reads 1 mile, and have it confirm like ""Calibrate stride? Do this when the teadmill reads 1 mile"".

Presumably this would be at LEAST as accurate as the outdoor method, except without requiring someone to do an outdoor workout to calibrate the indoor version.

Are there any third party apps capable of manually calibrating the apple watch walk/run stride?",1,calibrate apple watch walk run workout using treadmill basically gym indoor walk workout treadmill treadmill read mile perfectly accurate considering known length belt watch mile obviously make pace measurement comparison kinda useless official way calibrate indoor walk run stride outdoor run walk flat area good gps reception least minute learn far move many step make sense u live cold hilly gym membership specifically work inside option like say force touch screen workout app moment treadmill read mile confirm like calibrate stride teadmill read mile presumably would least accurate outdoor method except without requiring someone outdoor workout calibrate indoor version third party apps capable manually calibrating apple watch walk run stride,752
Problem with the Heartbeat Sensor,"Hi everyone!

High heart rate notifications while the device is off my wrist and or charging.,"So, I‚Äôm on the latest software for my Apple Watch series 3.

Emergency SOS wholesome story,"I just thought I'd share this story - this has happened to me yesterday evening, Australian time. I own Apple Watch Series 6 and to note: I am a deaf gentleman. I am very grateful for this amazing device.  


Here's what happened:   


I was riding an e-scooter along a bike path at a nearby park near the city however as I ride along; I made a poor judgement with the bike path, at the edge, the scooter unfortunately steered towards it, copped where I lost control of my e-scooter and I crashed. There were about 4-5 passerby's who witnessed the crash has rushed to my aid, I was in a terrible state - but what happened when I crashed, my Apple watch initialised the emergency SOS instantly calling the emergency services (but someone has called, same time) however what the watch did, it automatically notified my parents, which they instantly received the message and accurate GPS location of where I am, that has prompted my mother to call my phone which one people who assisted me, answered and informed of what happened. The ambulance arrived soon after; they took me to hospital.  


If it was not for them and my apple watch, I would have been lying on the ground, injured because I am deaf. I am very grateful for the apple watch series 6 who did an excellent job - it has saved my life. With my accident, I sustained a broken nose, superficial injuries to my face &amp; arms.

Great triple charger? (not Belkin Boost),"I have an Apple Watch series 3, iPhone 12 Pro, and AirPods Pro. I was sick of the pile of wires I had to deal with to charge all three. So I figured that the Belkin Boost 3-in-1 charger with MagSafe would be the ideal charging station for my nightstand.

But...
1. The MagSafe mount for the phone holds it nearly vertical and isn‚Äôt strong enough to keep the phone from falling to the floor if it‚Äôs even nudged a little bit. I have a very thin clear plastic case. It‚Äôs not MagSafe, but c‚Äômon who does? Don‚Äôt suspend my phone in the air if your ‚ÄúMag‚Äù isn‚Äôt strong enough to be really ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.
2. The charger for the AirPods Pro requires the charging case to be perfectly lined up and the light only turns on after it‚Äôs been lined up for a second or two, which means you don‚Äôt really get real-time feedback for where to put it. If it‚Äôs not perfect, the charge won‚Äôt work but your case will get nice and hot. (yikes!)

Help me correct my 315 day streak!,"Hi hive mind, 

I'm really hoping you can help me out on this one. Yesterday arvo I had my iPhone swapped due to a failing logic board. It had been backed up, find my iPhone turned off, etc. The one thing the Apple team forgot to remind me of was to unpair my watch before I left the shopping centre. I rode my bike home from the shops (about 5 miles) and just barely closed all 3 rings before midnight. My stats (I took a photo of my watch before I paired them again) and it should be 630/621 calories; 67/30mins; 14/12 stand mins. Because my new phone wasn't set up before going home (we're in the middle of a pandemic and I couldn't hang around at the store for a couple hours) I closed my rings on my watch while they were unpaired. As a result, I lost about half of my calories for the day, and 6 hours of my stand goal. In the past I feel I've been able to add in activity (when my watch died during a workout -- not cheating) but it doesn't seem to be applying it this time. I've even downloaded a third party app called FitManual to try and log these burnt calories but nothing it working. 

Yesterday was my 315th day in a row closing my rings, and my goal is to get 365 days straight so seeing that my current streak is 0 due to a technical complication is absolutely devastating. Please help me figure this out.

does resetting fitness calibration data delete my existing activity ring records?,"So I got my brand new AWS6 back in Jan, worked well for me until a couple of weeks ago when it started having problems recording my activity minutes.

But lately regardless of how much I walked and exercised, I can't seem to complete my activity rings (beside stand ring). 

usually a 30/40mins run will clock me at least 30ish minutes of workout, but it was registered as 2mins. I sometimes get too lazy to start a workout before running because previously it registers well, but now even if I clocked a 30mins outdoor walk, it'll be registered as 3mins exercise, (only reason I can find is that my heart rate chart isn't available but state that my avg heart rate is 106bpm) 

I tried re-pairing my watch, restarting, turning on and off the fitness and heart tracking, because I believe my heart rate tracking is partly involved. so I‚Äôm wondering if a reset of fitness calibration data helps? and will it delete my previous activity ring records? 


tldr: move and exercise ring not closing despite moving a lot at work, workouts are not helping because heart rate chart isn't available despite wearing my watch tightly. wondering if resetting fitness calibration data helps? and would it delete my existing activity ring records?

"Series 3 with Fitness+, Rings Highly Inaccurate Lately, Not Counting Work Outs","Signed up for Fitness+ a couple months ago and absolutely loved it. It was spot on with my work out and I loved the classes and everything was synced up.

The past two weeks, it's frustrating because my Apple watch's Fitness app refuses to accurately track my workouts. It's been sloppy, like instead of registering 30 minutes of say stationary bike riding, it used to close my rings at almost exactly 30 minutes, but now it closes my rings after 36 minutes. 

With Fitness+ and my Fitness rings, it's really gone off the rails the past couple weeks. I just did a 30 minute dance class and I look down and my watch Rings only tracked 5 minutes of it. I switched to a HIIT class and again after 20 minutes, I look down and it's only tracked 8 minutes of it. It's so inaccurate that it's practically useless as a tracking device at this point.

Yes, my heart rate is elevated for almost all of the 30 minutes so it's not like I'm under 60bpm for most of the class except for 5 minutes of it. Yes, I'm wearing my watch properly, and nothing has changed with my workout space or my wrist size or my watch band or anything since it was working perfectly a couple months ago. Yes, my heart rate is showing about 100bpm in the Health app for nearly the entire time so the watch is reporting my heart rate to Healthkit properly.

I just got a 5 watch, can I set the breathe app as a timer so I see how long I did the breathing if I want to do it for longer than a minute? for the statistics of it. for now, i track it in workout as yoga but I also track my training as gymnastics so it kinda wrecks my stats so id like to separate the two. otherwise, I could just not track my training and only track my breathing sessions because the stats for that are more important for me to track, it would be a bit of a shame for such a nice device.

thanks and have a nice day :) &lt;3",1,breathe app timer hi got watch set breathe app timer see long breathing want longer minute statistic track workout yoga also track training gymnastics kinda wreck stats id like separate two otherwise could track training track breathing session stats important track would bit shame nice device thanks nice day lt,313

Apple Watch as a running workout tracker - 1 year review,"Having owned my 42mm Apple watch S3 (non cellular version) for little over a year now, I thought it might be interesting to share my experience. I wear my watch daily, though I mostly use the watch as a workout tracker while running. When deciding which watch to buy, I considered dedicated fitness trackers such as the Garmin watches. Since I also own an iPhone, I decided to stay in the Apple world. 

**The good**

* The build quality and style is superb. While I don't think it is as elegant as a fancy analog watch, I do greatly prefer the looks of the Apple watch above all of the dedicated fitness trackers watches.
* The overall integration within the Apple ecosystem has been great. Syncing health metrics with 3rd party apps and pairing other sensors with Apple Health has been flawless. Everything just works once the correct permissions in the Apple Health app have been set.
* Having GPS, activity tracking and music with just the watch and a set of bluetooth earbuds while running is a great experience. No need to carry anything else, just put on your running shoes and head out the door.
* Battery life has been fantastic when *raise to wake* is disabled. On an average day, starting with a full charged watch at 8 o'clock (8AM) in the morning I have about 80% of battery left around bedtime at 23h (11PM). With so much battery left, I can track my sleep and have enough battery for the next day with a quick (partial) charge in the morning.
* The App store allows your to install 3rd party applications such as WorkOutDoors, iSmoothRun or the Stryd app, so you're not stuck with the limited Apple workouts app.

**The bad**

* Transferring music or audiobooks to the watch is near impossible without using the Apple Music or Book apps. You can't sync a downloaded Spotify or YouTube Music playlist, even though there's an app on the watch for both. The cellular version will stream Spotify music, but the cellular version was not available where I live when I purchased the watch. Similarly, you can't import or transfer an audiobook you purchased outside the Apple store with the Books app. One solution is the iCatcher app, but it feels more like a hack rather than a clean solution.
* Raise to wake is very battery consuming. While it works 95% of the time I want it to work, it also lights up the screen when I don't want to, especially while running. More annoying than the battery drain, is that the opposite motion, lowering and turning your wrist turns the screen off even when you have ""tap to wake 70 seconds"" enabled. This often happens when running when I want to have a quick glance at my watch but the natural movement of my arms turns off the screen. The best solution I have come up with, is to use cinema mode when not running and disable it when running. 
* The Shortcuts app has great potential, but is currently quite limited for the Apple Watch. For example ""When I start/end a workout"" does not work on my current watch when starting a workout with a 3rd party app. A shortcut to start a workout playlist and disable the cinema mode seems fantastic.
* The heart rate monitoring is great for everyday activities, but accuracy decreases as the intensity of your workout increases. While there are some in depth analysis by eg. DC rainmaker that show that the Apple Watch is among the most accurate optical wrist worn heart rate monitors, it generally overestimates my heart rate by as much as 10 beats when doing tempo runs compared to my chest strap. There's also no indication of how accurate the heart rate monitoring was like there is for GPS accuracy. If the watches loses your heart rate during a run for 5 minutes, it will use it's last measured value until it is able to determine your heart rate again. You can easily recognize these longer periods where your heart rate stayed constant, but it would be nice to have some indication of the heart rate monitoring accuracy.
* Apple Health syncs everything between all the health related apps, but it does not seem to detect duplicates. While you can disable write permissions for one of both apps, it would be nice if duplicates were detected and removed.
* On a related note, Apple Health tracks a lot of metrics but (running) power is currently not one of them. You can pair other fitness sensors with the watch, such as the Stryd foot pod or a bike power meter, but you can't sync any power data with the Apple Health app. So, checking your power statistics in an app like HealthFit is not possible.
* The watch will mirror the notifications of your phone, but your phone won't mirror the notifications of your watch such as the updates about your activity goals throughout the day. I like to use the watch to see what the notification is, but if my phone is around I'll use the phone to reply on the notification as the watch screen is limited in size.

 **The ugly**

* Limited storage capacity. With only four 3rd party apps installed, my watch won't install WatchOS updates complaining there's too little storage space. Having to unpair your watch, update and restore from a backup gets old very quickly. 
* The activity goals are the same for every day, and they're always absolute and not relative. On the days I go running, I easily double or triple my exercise (600 kcal) and movement (60 min) goals. While, on a lazy Sunday, I might only start wearing the watch in the afternoon. By doing this, it will be incredibly difficult to reach the movement and exercise goals and impossible to reach the stand goal. I understand that these goals are there to motivate you, but some flexibility to allow for higher goals on exercise days and lower goals on easy days seems nice. At the minimum, it seems nice to set active hours, for example from 9 in the morning (9 AM) to 9 in the evening (9 PM). That way, if you only wear the watch from 12 'till 6, you would only need to complete 50% of your goals instead of feeling bad that you didn't reach your goals.

Despite my many remarks, I'm still happy about my purchase and would recommend the watch to other people looking for a workout tracker. Though I am curious if any has any solutions or workarounds for my remarks.

TLDR  
The Apple Watch is a great watch for tracking running workouts if you're already in the Apple ecosystem. Pair a heart rate chest strap to the watch if the heart rate monitoring is inaccurate at higher speeds. Sync your run with your preffered 3rd party app to their platform if you want running metrics not supported by Apple Health.",1,apple watch running workout tracker year review owned mm apple watch non cellular version little year thought might interesting share experience wear watch daily though mostly use watch workout tracker running deciding watch buy considered dedicated fitness tracker garmin watch since also iphone decided stay apple world good build quality style superb think elegant fancy analog watch greatly prefer look apple watch dedicated fitness tracker watch overall integration within apple ecosystem great syncing health metric rd party apps pairing sensor apple health flawless everything work correct permission apple health app set gps activity tracking music watch set bluetooth earbuds running great experience need carry anything else put running shoe head door battery life fantastic raise wake disabled average day starting full charged watch clock morning battery left around bedtime h pm much battery left track sleep enough battery next day quick partial charge morning app store allows install rd party application workoutdoors ismoothrun stryd app stuck limited apple workout app bad transferring music audiobooks watch near impossible without using apple music book apps sync downloaded spotify youtube music playlist even though app watch cellular version stream spotify music cellular version available live purchased watch similarly import transfer audiobook purchased outside apple store book app one solution icatcher app feel like hack rather clean solution raise wake battery consuming work time want work also light screen want especially running annoying battery drain opposite motion lowering turning wrist turn screen even tap wake second enabled often happens running want quick glance watch natural movement arm turn screen best solution come use cinema mode running disable running shortcut app great potential currently quite limited apple watch example start end workout work current watch starting workout rd party app shortcut start workout playlist disable cinema mode seems fantastic heart rate monitoring great everyday activity accuracy decrease intensity workout increase depth analysis eg dc rainmaker show apple watch among accurate optical wrist worn heart rate monitor generally overestimate heart rate much beat tempo run compared chest strap also indication accurate heart rate monitoring like gps accuracy watch loses heart rate run minute use last measured value able determine heart rate easily recognize longer period heart rate stayed constant would nice indication heart rate monitoring accuracy apple health syncs everything health related apps seem detect duplicate disable write permission one apps would nice duplicate detected removed related note apple health track lot metric running power currently one pair fitness sensor watch stryd foot pod bike power meter sync power data apple health app checking power statistic app like healthfit possible watch mirror notification phone phone mirror notification watch update activity goal throughout day like use watch see notification phone around use phone reply notification watch screen limited size ugly limited storage capacity four rd party apps installed watch install watchos update complaining little storage space unpair watch update restore backup get old quickly activity goal every day always absolute relative day go running easily double triple exercise kcal movement min goal lazy sunday might start wearing watch afternoon incredibly difficult reach movement exercise goal impossible reach stand goal understand goal motivate flexibility allow higher goal exercise day lower goal easy day seems nice minimum seems nice set active hour example morning evening pm way wear watch till would need complete goal instead feeling bad reach goal despite many remark still happy purchase would recommend watch people looking workout tracker though curious solution workarounds remark tldr apple watch great watch tracking running workout already apple ecosystem pair heart rate chest strap watch heart rate monitoring inaccurate higher speed sync run preffered rd party app platform want running metric supported apple health,4128
Why does it stop sampling once HR rises?,"Unsure if this is related to latest update or not.

My Apple Watch increases HR sampling interval to unreasonable (20min+ instead of regular 4-5min) lengths if I undertake any kind of vigorous (150bpm+ seems most affected) activity without starting a workout. As soon as it gets a low reading it reverts to regular intervals.

I could've sworn it used to be the other way around, sampling more when detecting high HR/activity.

Despite all evidence to the contrary I can't believe Apple would ship such an obvious bug (coder literally mistaking * for / or interval for frequency), and even more confusing is I can't find anything online about this issue.


Resulting problems:

-Strava workouts all have HR ""chart unavailable"" unless I double up and record a workout on Apple Watch in parallell (tho that's also because Strava for some reason doesn't write HR data from HRM chest strap to Health...)

-Half the time exercise ring won't move _at all_ if I'm doing something randomly really strenuous that isn't ""start a workout"" worthy, whereas a brisk walk will fill it up plenty quick.

-Health data in general but especially apps like HeartAnalyzer get very spotty and incomplete max HR values to work with.


(Strava workout sources are cycling computer and apps like Zwift and TrainerRoad)

[Solved] Tizen Studio Edje unable to load image,"I ran into a bug in Tizen Studio, and the few posts about it on the Tizen forums were from 2014, and offered no working solutions...and it's still not fixed in 2021.

As soon as you migrate a project from the default workspace (and sometimes even in the default workspace folder), the error happens...

**Here is the solution:**

**In Tizen Studio, right click on the project name, properties, CC++ build, settings, EDC resource compiler, misc, and change the paths to the full folder location paths. Save and exit out of the settings. Changing the paths in the Edje editor settings itself is not sufficient to fix this issue.**

By default, Tizen Studio has paths that start with code that is supposed to direct it to your project, and then to your image (and also sounds, and fonts) folder. Tizen Studio cannot correctly interpret the locations because of its own default code, and requires the full paths. After inputting the paths, open the Edje editor, and the images should load correctly. If they still don't, then close out of Tizen Studio, open it back up, and go back into the Edje editor.

Ok I give in this thing is pretty damn cool,"So my girlfriend got me the Galaxy 3 Smartwatch for my birthday a few weeks ago.  ""Cool,"" I said, thinking this would end up as another expensive electronic in a drawer somewhere, as I've tried to wear watches before, but they never last very long. I've already got a smartphone, do I REALLY need the watch?


Turns out no, but actually yes.


Right off the bat. The ability to skip tracks or turn the volume down on my music while at work is really freaking handy. Although it would be nice if I could set the Bezel to default change volume rather than skip tracks, it's a pretty handy feature that overall has saved me time already not having to pull put my phone or walk over to get it (only have youtube music no spotify premium account so I can't full on stream yet).


The heartrate monitor and step counter - never really thought I would use that stuff, but I found a watchface that keeps that info handy without getting in the way too much, and now I find myself constantly checking up on it.  Honestly I don't think it's all that accurate, but it's a good ballpark estimate to guage my activity level for the day.


Snake - this classic game has finally made a comeback for me in a fun new challenge.  Use the bezel to turn the snake, difficult but actually works pretty well. .I haven't played this game since the old Nokias and it holds up, and plays well on the watch I must admit.


Stopwatch with laptimer, the find my phone feature has saved my countess minutes already (though I'm pissed they are taking away GPS location finding just as I start using it), samsung pay - vendors are catching up in my area with tap to pay so that's nice.


But here's the really cool thing that's got me absolutely sold on the watch and I wasn't even expecting it. Currently we are doing a bunch of renovations on the house, so I have been moving my TV from one room to another trying to keep some semblance of a living space.  I recently got an hdmi cord and adapter to plug my phone in to my TV using Dex to watch Netflix, with audio going to a soundbar (or headphones!), I can use my watch like a TV remote! Play/pause/volume control from my watch?  What?  It's so unnecessary but so freaking cool.

"Can I set up automatic heart rate, stress, blood oxygen and blood pressure readings on a Galaxy Watch 3?","Hey all,


I got smacked with the genetic short end of the stick and my blood pressure and heart rate are fairly variable. It's not a lot of fun and there's not a great deal of treatment available.There are biofeedback exercises I can do when I'm aware that things are getting wonky, but it's hard to explain how difficult it is to consciously realize things are off when they're off.


I used to have a service dog to do this, I've been 7 years without my dog and my life has been really hard without that external measure. The right tech to unobtrusively measure heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen, and galvanic skin response and notify me when things were off-kilter would radically change my life, so I'm really excited about the possibility of getting one of these watches.


I'm poking around in the Samsung Health app on my phone to try to see if there's any indication of what I could automate on a smart watch, I'm failing. So, which of the sensors can I set to continuous monitoring, which can I set to check every 5/10/15/whatever minutes? Are there any other devices that can do this kind of thing if the Samsung Galaxy Watch3 can't?

I got the update for blood pressure a few weeks ago, but you apparently need to calibrate using values from another device first.  Is there a way round this?

Problems with ECG readings on GWA2,"Hi all, I received the ECG update on my GWA2 recently and have struggled to get a proper reading from it. 

Most of the time the amplitude of the waveform just goes off the top and bottom of the screen and after 5 seconds, it resets and asks me to try again. Usually I have to hold my finger on the bezel button for a good 10-20 seconds before it starts.

Other times, the waveform settles down after a minute or so and then oddly, it gets a perfect reading.

A few occasions it has given a perfect reading straight off the bat!

I've tried repositioning the watch, wetting the back/my wrist etc, trying every angle possible with my finger. 

Last week I ordered a GW3 to see what that was like and the ECG works perfectly everytime so I guess there must be an issue with the GWA2 sensor?

I can see some previous threads on this topic and also discussion on XDA developers - has anyone managed to get theirs working successfully without returning the watch?",0,problem ecg reading gwa hi received ecg update gwa recently struggled get proper reading time amplitude waveform go top bottom screen second reset asks try usually hold finger bezel button good second start time waveform settle minute oddly get perfect reading occasion given perfect reading straight bat tried repositioning watch wetting back wrist etc trying every angle possible finger last week ordered gw see like ecg work perfectly everytime guess must issue gwa sensor see previous thread topic also discussion xda developer anyone managed get working successfully without returning watch,595

Galaxy Active 2 LTE - Free Up Storage Space?,"I recently picked up a Galaxy Active 2 LTE. I was surprised to see only 1.2GB usable storage with a new watch. I can't see any way to delete anything but a few apps which only frees up maybe 100MB, and most of those are useful apps that I'd rather not delete.

Is the bulk of that space just utilized by the OS?

I have at least a couple hundred songs that consume about 2GB of space that I currently use for my workout playlist. I don't have a paid Spotify account either and don't plan on it. A lot of my music aren't even on Spotify as they're ripped songs from live concert albums or from foreign markets or as odd as it sounds, sometimes some motivational clips.

I have been using a Samsung Gear Fit2 for years and it has over 2.6GB of usable space which was fine. I assumed this watch would have similar storage capacity. 

I really like the sleek profile of the Active 2, but am still in my return period and considering the Watch 3 LTE instead since it has 8GB RAM, as it seems my only other option for Samsung, and only costs $30 more than the Active 2.

I guess my only other option is to make due with the Active 2 and wait on the Active 3, although hate to only have a watch for less than a year and then ditch it for another expensive watch.",0,galaxy active lte free storage space recently picked galaxy active lte surprised see gb usable storage new watch see way delete anything apps free maybe mb useful apps rather delete bulk space utilized o least couple hundred song consume gb space currently use workout playlist paid spotify account either plan lot music even spotify ripped song live concert album foreign market odd sound sometimes motivational clip using samsung gear fit year gb usable space fine assumed watch would similar storage capacity really like sleek profile active still return period considering watch lte instead since gb ram seems option samsung cost active guess option make due active wait active although hate watch le year ditch another expensive watch,739

I traded in my galaxy watch 1 with Samsung when buying, that was always 100% the same effort consistency no matter what.

Is my new watch normal? Did they just change how it works, or do I have a faulty watch?  I guess as it's mainly just the first click, it could be intentional design to make unwanted turns less likely?

Watch suddenly stopped vibrationg on notifications.,"As the title suggests my Watch stopped to vibrate when i get notifications. This started when i updated my iPhone 3 days ago to the newest version. the ( LE ) thing keeps its connection but the one without the LE just disconnects as soon as i lock my phone thus negating any vibration on notifications.

Long press remapping of your button is a thing now?üëç,"I just got a Galaxy Watch 3 today after selling my Active2 last week. I noticed you can remap a double press of the button, ***or a long press***. Samsung watches have been in dire need of more button remapping options, and this was a pleasant surprise. Did I miss this option in a recent update of the Active2, or is this only available on the GW3 right now?

Update: You can only remap the long press to open the power menu, or to launch Bixby. However since Samsung removed the ability to open Bixby voice with a shortcut about a year ago, I have had to use up the double press for Bixby in the past. It's nice to still have the double press button open to whichever app I choose.",0,long press remapping button thing got galaxy watch today selling active last week noticed remap double press button long press samsung watch dire need button remapping option pleasant surprise miss option recent update active available gw right update remap long press open power menu launch bixby however since samsung removed ability open bixby voice shortcut year ago use double press bixby past nice still double press button open whichever app choose,455

GW - How to get latest update on ANY Galaxy watch 42/46mm,"Hi y'all i'll be brief , This guide you to downgrade to change CSC and update to the **last update**  
(**R810XXU1FUB6 Tizen 5.5.0.1 | 2021-02-25**)  
  
REGARDLRESS OF YOUR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN  
 
**This is for Galaxy Watch SM-R810 or SM-R800 | 42mm and 46mm** (hit me up for other models please)    
  
#**NOW ALSO SUPPORT SM-R500 - GALAXY ACTIVE** 
  
Doing this because it was a bit of a mess finding proper information online yesterday when i downgraded my watch to change my CSC ; essentially making my watch a ""USA/American"" watch as they have access to the LAST UPDATE and so can you.

**WHAT YOU NEED** : 
- [Firmware CSG4](https://4pda.ru/pages/go/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmega.nz%2F%23!CwMGzSAI!g1Bxc0Rm45V2EL38S29QEW3mpHJPc33CQeLuK_zsyTw&amp;e=92121314) For 42mm watch (SM-R810)
- [Firmware CSG4](https://4pda.ru/pages/go/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmega.nz%2F%23!ShFyUQYS!FQKD7ydpTJ40-Ooks_JXW85bwIVW00NaTWdj4vJhPjs&amp;e=92121314) For 46mm watch (SM-R800)  
  
  
- [Firmware ASAD](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=11410963190603915888) For original Active watch (SM-R500)

- [GW - CSC Swap Kit ](http://www.mediafire.com/file/0do2j47owrced33/GW_-_CSC_Swap_Kit_2021.rar/file) (SDB and Netodin)  
- Your Watch is Charged to 90% or more.  
- Backup your watch on the Galaxy Wearable app on your phone ( OPTIONAL )  

**WHAT DO DO ?**  

- Extract ""GW - CSC Swap Kit.zip"" to any folder of your choice.   
   This will give you 2 folder ( NetOdin3_1.0 and sdb_2.2.89_windows-32 ).  
  
- Extract the Firmware CSG4 (42mm or 46mm) in the same folder.   
   This will give you 3 files AP_R8***.usr.tar.md5 , BL_R8***.usr.tar.md5 and CSC_OXA_R8***.usr.tar.md5 we will need them later.  
  

- Put your watch into AP MODE  
  

  **1 -** Hold POWER until the screen shows Rbooting.. tap on power 2-3 times 
  

  **2 -** On the new screen press power to go down to ""Download(wireless)"" Hold power to enter.  
  

  **3 -** You're in the WPS mode now , Double press Power to go in AP MODE.  
  

**AP MODE create a Wi-Fi network from your Watch , CONNECT your computer to the ""hidden network"" or the network maybe named ""SM-R810"" etc..**
  

  If you see hidden network click it , Windows will ask the SSID this will either be SM-R810 or SM-R800 (your watch model basically..)
  

Others might see a network with the model of their watch ( either SM-R810 or SM-R800 ) 
  EITHER way connect to it before the next step  
  

   **The Next Steps is where you Actually downgrade the watch to a version we will be able to easily change the CSC Region**    
 
 
- Open the NetOdin3_1.0 folder and Run **NetOdin3_1.0.exe** 
  [In NetOdin do like in my screenshot](https://imgur.com/sfXNBqQ)  
   
  
**PATIENCE This step takes 10-15 minutes , in the meantime reconnect to your normal Wi-Fi on your computer**  
  

- Once the watch is restarted you'll want to enable debugging   
  

  **1 -** Enable debugging on the watch.  
    (Settings&gt; About Watch&gt; Debugging).  
  

 **2-** Turn off bluetooth on watch  
  
 **3-** REBOOT WATCH or SDB will not connect
  

- Connect your watch to your normal Wi-Fi and get its IP ( Settings&gt; Connections&gt; Wi-Fi&gt; Wi-Fi Networks&gt; CLICK your Wi-Fi&gt; Down there is your IP 192.168.X.X (usually)  
   NOTE your Watch IP down.  
  
- Changing CSC : Open the sdb_2.2.89_windows-32 folder , Run Install.bat and open Data\Tools folder , Run **ansicon.exe**  
  

 **1 -** a new window will open type in : ""sdb connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"" &lt;- replace the xxx by the ip you noted and dont put the quotes..  
  
   ON YOUR WATCH A AUTHORIZATION WILL POP UP WATCH FOR IT !! AND ACCEPT !! , do not screw this one up.    
  

**1.5- !ONLY IF IT FAILS TO CONNECT! .. TRY THIS :   
  Connect the watch and your computer to your cellphone WiFi hotspot ""sharing"" (if connected than continue other steps as normal ) ..**   
  
  
  **2 -** it should read as in my [screenshot](https://imgur.com/aSA5ZOx) (in green is what i typed , your ip will differ slightly !)  
    
    
  **3 -** now type : sdb pull /csa/csc/csc-active-customer.inf  
  
  **4 -** now type : sdb shell  
  
  **5 -** dont erase nothing and type : **launch_app csc-manager.csc-pre-configuration**  
  
  **6 - ON YOUR WATCH** , select the CSC of your choice ( you will normallly see your CSC there , you can note it.)  
  
     XAR is the Goal here , its USA and they get update first , and its what we want too..  
  
**DONE !**  
  
The Watch will reboot , and you can follow the normal update route itll be 2 update in a row. ( DTG1 and then the latest FUB6 )

Custom apps?,"I'm interested in creating a simple timer app for keeping track of trips for work that would run on the Galaxy Watch. 

Is it possible to program my own app? Once I create it how would I load it on the watch?

I'm looking for an app that would allow me to record several times for each trip to distinguish between legs in the journey. Each time also has a mode of travel associated with it and they aren't always the same. This data would ideally be saved as a text file or csv, so that from time to time I could transfer it to my spreadsheet. 

Example Data

01/01/21, 9:15:04am, bus, 9:36:27am, train, 10:20:45am, walking, 10:36:22am, end

01/01/21, 9:05:49am, cab, 9:16:32am, walking, 9:20:17am, end

I could also copy the data from the watch but some kind of file transfer would be best. I used to have an android app that did this but my company won't let me put ""outside"" apps on my phone, so I thought I could put the app on the watch. 

Anyone have any experience with creating such apps for the watch?

Some aspects that Galaxy Watch Studio can improve,"I actually knew about Galaxy Watch Studio a long time ago but didn't have time to try it out.

I just installed Galaxy Watch Studio and found out there are some aspects that it can improve.

1. Recently, I used WatchMaker a little bit. The reason I used WatchMaker is that it can use Tasker to communicate with the phone. It can use the watch to run Tasker tasks on the phone and receive data from the phone to be displayed on the watch. This is the first thing I'd suggest Galaxy Watch Studio improve. 
2. In WatchMaker, there are a lot of watch backgrounds, watch hands to choose from. I don't know whether there is such kind of official packages to import into GWS. I can only find limited items in GWS by default.
3. The GUI of Galaxy Watch Studio is poorly made. I just installed version 2.0 on my laptop. My laptop has a resolution of 2560x1440, and I set the display magnification to 200%. So it's effectively 1280x720. After loading the interface, some parts of the window are not displaying correctly. For example, the left design window and right preview window don't show the whole round watch face. If this is understandable because of my low-resolution screen, then the next one is not. When I build the project, the dialog window does not fit my screen, and the build button is out of my window, so I can't click on it. The software should consider all possible situations the software might be running in. If there are too many items to display in the dialog window, then add a scroll bar.",0,aspect galaxy watch studio improve actually knew galaxy watch studio long time ago time try installed galaxy watch studio found aspect improve recently used watchmaker little bit reason used watchmaker use tasker communicate phone use watch run tasker task phone receive data phone displayed watch first thing suggest galaxy watch studio improve watchmaker lot watch background watch hand choose know whether kind official package import gws find limited item gws default gui galaxy watch studio poorly made installed version laptop laptop resolution x set display magnification effectively x loading interface part window displaying correctly example left design window right preview window show whole round watch face understandable low resolution screen next one build project dialog window fit screen build button window click software consider possible situation software might running many item display dialog window add scroll bar,937

[EU ONLY] [GUIDE] ECG with every smartphone,"EDIT: This may work on all the countries that have ECG enabled by default,

Canada, USA, EU confirmed

We figured out that (at the moment) the latest version of SMH only works for Galaxy phones, so if you don't have a Galaxy phone and you want to enable ECG on your watch  just follow this guide.

Your watch **must be from UE** and you **must have the latest update installed (Tizen 5.5.0.2)**

1. Enable ""*install app from unknown sources*"" on the galaxy wear app on your smartphone (it's located on ""*info about the watch*"")
2. Install [this apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oJCFKOx3raIBg2N1KK_lhYSFElH3TnLA/view?usp=sharing) on your phone (will install ecg monitor on your watch)
3. Install [Samsung Health monitor mod](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A4kqN7KdZ4_qKgro94FslhM97-1bn6BZ/view?usp=sharing) on your phone
4. Done, ECG works fine now.

BP needs a certificate that's different for every device, you need a signed APK of the BP with your own certificate, so if you're interested in BP just follow [this video](https://youtu.be/zAclEJMDrhI?t=454) of *Dante63* (Start from minute 7:45) it's a little bit complicated but it's well explained on his video.Remember to skip every part of the ECG as you already have it.

If you have doubts/problems just ask in the comments.

credits: Dante63 on [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/root-detection-removed-samsung-health-monitor-1-1-0-183-country-restriction-removed-11th-feb-2021.4202685/) for the links.",0,eu guide ecg every smartphone edit may work country ecg enabled default canada usa eu confirmed figured moment latest version smh work galaxy phone galaxy phone want enable ecg watch follow guide watch must ue must latest update installed tizen enable install app unknown source galaxy wear app smartphone located info watch install apk phone install ecg monitor watch install samsung health monitor mod phone done ecg work fine bp need certificate different every device need signed apk bp certificate interested bp follow video dante start minute little bit complicated well explained video remember skip every part ecg already doubt problem ask comment credit dante xda link,677

Sorry, but apparently no solution was found yet - except for sending the watch for repairs.

One thing you can try to diagnose the issue is get the magical value of ""L-0"". Apparently the value of anything but ""0"" means a hardware failure. To find the ""L-0"" you can follow these steps:

* Type \*#0\*# on watch keyboard (in e.g. Phone app)
* Tap 7 Times on testmode
* Scroll down and tap on ""2TEST""
* Put your finger on the top button and wait to get ""L-0"" value

&amp;#x200B;

[The cursed L-0 value of 5](https://preview.redd.it/aysx9fwv11j61.jpg?width=360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16095546b7f1e9ba859d41397268e8dbc57203cd)

Maybe comment your ""L-0"" value if your ECG doesn't work?   
If you have the warranty and a way to get repairs - I would say go for it. I didn't find a way to get the warranty repair done in Finland (I bought the watch abroad), so I'm probably going to yell at ~~the cloud~~ Samsung.

"Uh oh. By bye, battery life and good standalone apps","If this is true, it is gonna make it  a lot harder for me to stick with GW devices.  I have nothing against Android Wear (and have tried a few watches over the years, including in 2019).  But it has basically been left to die on the vine by Google for the last 4 years with little to no serious updates.

And, yeah, AW has FAR better developer support FOR BLUETOOTH WATCHES.  Both AW and Apple have very few standalone apps with full functionality for the their LTE models.  On my GW3, I have music, radio, 2FA, list/notes, voice/recording &amp;  to text, browser, music search (Shazam-like functionality), radar weather, Yelp/Places/POI finder,  memos, podcasts, navigation (with full Google Maps functionality), translation, unit conversion, etc..  When I tried AW in 2019, it had virtually none of these for standalone watch use.

Google Maps in particular was an embarrassment on the AW watches.  When out and about with the AW watch, to use nav, it had to send all of the router date for processing through the Google Maps on your phone at home, so it took FOREVER to adjust to the next turn. Totally useless when driving.

Worse, AW, like Watch OS, is a battery hog.  There is no way you can get through a day on LTE only.  Not even close.  Tizen is a way more battery efficient OS.  On my GW, I would have 60-65% left at the end of an LTE-only day.  Even on my GW3, I end the day with 30-35%.

Between this kind of stuff and Samsung stripping away key features on the Watch (MST and battery)  while raising its price (and immediately having to heavily discount it), it is hard to see what the strategy is.  At least when the company stripped RAM, display resolution, micro-SD and MST from the S21 phone line, it dropped the price $200.  Maybe Samsung will sell its watch biz to Google in a couple of years after letting Google test drive it with this ""partnership"" for now.

Instructions on how to use your Samsung Galaxy Watch as a ant+ heart rate monitor for the Peloton Digital App / Zwift / etc," Hello Everyone.

I use the Peloton Digital App with my IC4 Schwinn bike and I found a way of using my Galaxy Watch Active 2 to track my heart rate during classes. With this method, your Galaxy Watch will work as an ant+ heart rate monitor, allowing to display and track your heart rate on the Peloton app in real time.

In order to do so, you will have to download the HR and Speed transmitter app on your watch. The app costs about 5 dollars and it's available on the Galaxy Store. More info here [Broadcast heart rate from Samsung watch to Zwift over Bluetooth Low Energy (bipr.fr)](https://bipr.fr/Samsung-Galaxy-Active-Review-HR-on-Zwift)

After opening the app on your Galaxy Watch, you will be able to add it as a heart rate monitor on the Peloton Digital app. The method is the same for other apps, like Zwift.

A watch face that can do all of this?,"Hi there!

Last week I got gifted a **Gear s3 Frontier**. It's my first smart watch and I love it! However, I can't find a watch face that truly satisfies me. There are many amazing ones out there that do several things I would love to have, but the ones I've found also miss one or two. So I wonder, with so many options out there, could there be one (or more) that checks all boxes?

I really want to have:  
 \- Analogue \_dark\_ watch face. Preferably chronograph/aviator style.  
 \- Day of the month number + day of the week  
 \- Battery charge  
 \- Temperature  
 \- Heart rate  
 \- Moon phase

Bonus if it has:  
 \- World clock (eg. rotating ring like here: [https://galaxy.store/supertech](https://galaxy.store/supertech))  
 \- Weather indicator  
 \- Altitude/pressure  
 \- Custom app shortcuts

I don't care about:  
 \- Step count, calories burned, etc. I would prefer NOT to have these on the face.  
 \- Always on look (I never use always on)

So, any of you know a face that can do these? If so, please share! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I was looking into the option of making my own. I can create textures and graphic designs, but I'm not a developer. I've found that there are two apps that let you easily create custom faces, called Facer and Watchmaker but I have my concerns:

A face that is put together from separately editable elements will never be as efficient and stable as a properly made normal face. So I'm worried about both stability, and faster battery drain due to overuse of resources.

Facer for example has a lot of recent 1 star reviews complaining about it taking several seconds for the watch to turn on after tapped. And also lot of people complain that it's full of ads and harassing you to rate and to pay for a subscription, even if you already paid. So I'm looking into Watchmaker now.

Do you have any experiences with these? Would you recommend them or rather recommend that I keep looking for a normal face that does what I want?

I wish there was a place where I can filter watch faces based on features. Samsung's store is garbage.",0,watch face hi last week got gifted gear frontier first smart watch love however find watch face truly satisfies many amazing one several thing would love one found also miss one two wonder many option could one check box really want analogue dark watch face preferably chronograph aviator style day month number day week battery charge temperature heart rate moon phase bonus world clock eg rotating ring like weather indicator altitude pressure custom app shortcut care step count calorie burned etc would prefer face always look never use always know face please share amp x b also looking option making create texture graphic design developer found two apps let easily create custom face called facer watchmaker concern face put together separately editable element never efficient stable properly made normal face worried stability faster battery drain due overuse resource facer example lot recent star review complaining taking several second watch turn tapped also lot people complain full ad harassing rate pay subscription even already paid looking watchmaker experience would recommend rather recommend keep looking normal face want wish place filter watch face based feature samsung store garbage,1207

Thinking of getting a new smart watch.,"Just got a Samsung z fold 2 (first Samsung phone since S7Edge) so I'm looking at the Galaxy watches .

**The Problem:** When a constantly-connected Bluetooth/BLE device, notably smartwatches (I've also had this problem in the past with Tile) has been set up on the phone; Bluetooth audio quality suffers immensely. Notable characteristics are that highs sound extremely compressed, often described as a ""hissing"" or ""static"" sound by those experiencing it. For audio nerds, it sounds like a sub-128kbps MP3 file, with lots of artifacts and noticeable data loss.

**The Devices:** I have personally experienced this issue in two scenarios now:

 Samsung Galaxy S10 5G (Verizon), using a Fitbit, as well as the same problem when I was using a Tile locator. I used both the Fitbit and Tile with my Pixel 2 XL and never had the issue until I switched to my S10 5G.

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (Verizon), while using my Samsung Galaxy Watch 3.

The problem seems isolated to certain phone models or manufacturers. Nexus/Pixel users historically don't seem to have any issues. Most reports seem to come from users of LG and Samsung phones. As mentioned, my problems I had a few years ago with my Fitbit and Tile didn't crop up until I switched from my Pixel to my Galaxy S10.

**The Details:** In my personal experience, the audio quality is affected on any device using AAC or SBC. I have noticed this in my cars, as well as my non-AptX or LDAC headphones. On these devices, you typically cannot change Bluetooth codecs. I have tried every option imaginable in developer options to no avail. Others seem to report the same.

The only way I have ever been able to remedy the problem is by completely disabling the smartwatch, ""disconnecting"" it in the phone companion app, and then restarting the phone with the watch turned off. Simply disconnecting or turning off the watch does not fix the problem, as the phone is still ""searching"" for the watch in the background even if it is disconnected, and even if you have force stopped the app. When I was using my Fitbit, the only way I could eliminate the issue entirely was by **uninstalling the Fitbit app from my phone.** 

It seems as though on certain platforms, particularly Samsung, a large chunk of Bluetooth bandwidth is being dedicated to the watch; and not enough is dedicated to the audio stream, and that dedication is permanent until the phone is restarted. Cycling Bluetooth on/off does not fix it.

**The Reality:** This is, for me, a deal-breaking issue. It was with my Fitbit on my S10, and it is now with my Watch 3 on my S21 Ultra. I listen to a LOT of music, especially in the car. Very few cars support any codec other than SBC; so you're really up a creek without a paddle if this is something that affects you. I've tried using Tasker to automate disabling/disconnecting the watch when connecting to my audio device, but as mentioned before, the only way you can remedy the problem is by completely turning the watch off, disconnecting it, and then restarting the phone. This isn't really a reasonable workaround for every time you get in the car.

This issue has been posted in a lot of places, and it seems to be a problem that has been around for 7-8+ years that has been completely unaddressed by Samsung, Google, or any relevant parties. When I selected my Watch 3 to go with my S21 Ultra, I had made the assumption that enough time had passed that the issue **had** to be resolved; especially with Bluetooth 5.0 and the improvements that have been made on the front of BT connectivity.

But here we are; years later, with no solution. Samsung has gone the route of eliminating the 3.5mm jack, so now if you're in the same boat as me, you're forced to choose between having Bluetooth audio that doesn't sound like AM radio, or having a smartwatch. You apparently aren't allowed to have both.

At this point I will likely be sending my Watch 3 back to Samsung, referencing what I've typed here today as my reasoning. I encourage anyone else with this issue to comment and add your input and experience as well. It may fall on deaf ears, but let the record show that Android users have been experiencing this same exact problem for almost a decade, and as manufacturers continue eliminating our choices and cornering us into Bluetooth, they fail to address the issues they present in doing so.",0,terrible bluetooth audio quality smartwatch saga going preface saying known issue popping internet since inception ble device smartwatches aggregation link found others issue found evidence problem reported others going back gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt problem constantly connected bluetooth ble device notably smartwatches also problem past tile set phone bluetooth audio quality suffers immensely notable characteristic high sound extremely compressed often described hissing static sound experiencing audio nerd sound like sub kbps mp file lot artifact noticeable data loss device personally experienced issue two scenario samsung galaxy g verizon using fitbit well problem using tile locator used fitbit tile pixel xl never issue switched g samsung galaxy ultra verizon using samsung galaxy watch problem seems isolated certain phone model manufacturer nexus pixel user historically seem issue report seem come user lg samsung phone mentioned problem year ago fitbit tile crop switched pixel galaxy detail personal experience audio quality affected device using aac sbc noticed car well non aptx ldac headphone device typically cannot change bluetooth codecs tried every option imaginable developer option avail others seem report way ever able remedy problem completely disabling smartwatch disconnecting phone companion app restarting phone watch turned simply disconnecting turning watch fix problem phone still searching watch background even disconnected even force stopped app using fitbit way could eliminate issue entirely uninstalling fitbit app phone seems though certain platform particularly samsung large chunk bluetooth bandwidth dedicated watch enough dedicated audio stream dedication permanent phone restarted cycling bluetooth fix reality deal breaking issue fitbit watch ultra listen lot music especially car car support codec sbc really creek without paddle something affect tried using tasker automate disabling disconnecting watch connecting audio device mentioned way remedy problem completely turning watch disconnecting restarting phone really reasonable workaround every time get car issue posted lot place seems problem around year completely unaddressed samsung google relevant party selected watch go ultra made assumption enough time passed issue resolved especially bluetooth improvement made front bt connectivity year later solution samsung gone route eliminating mm jack boat forced choose bluetooth audio sound like radio smartwatch apparently allowed point likely sending watch back samsung referencing typed today reasoning encourage anyone else issue comment add input experience well may fall deaf ear let record show android user experiencing exact problem almost decade manufacturer continue eliminating choice cornering u bluetooth fail address issue present,2815

GWA2 - How do I stop auto-started workouts?,"Hi,

I play tennis.  I try to remember to start a workout on my watch before the game starts, but I often forget.  Sometimes, the watch will detect that I'm playing and start a workout automatically.

The problem is that if we stop to take a break for a while, the auto-detected workout will stop.  And then the watch often doesn't realize when I've started playing again so the workout tracks the first few games and then never starts again.

To avoid that, as soon as I notice that the watch has started an auto-workout, I would like to stop the auto-workout and start a manual one instead.  But there doesn't seem to be any way to tell it to stop that auto-workout.

Am I missing something or is there an easy solution to my issue?

Gear S3 refuses to connect to my devices,"I understand that this is a GW sub but I was hoping maybe someone had a similar issue on that device that my help me fix mine!

My Gear S3 is in a pretty good condition but I haven't used it in what feels like forever. I charged it today and decided to start using it again but it refuses to connect to any of my devices.

Here are some details about my watch:

`SE for Tizen: 2.0.0`

`TIMA: 3.0.0`

Screen toughness,"Hi there!

Just a quick question about my new galaxy watch 3. 

Does anybody recommend a screen protector? Because I bought one recently, and it didn't quite fit on the screen. You could still see a little edge all around. And I didn't like that. I wanted it FULL all around. 

I've seen one from Spigen (EZ fit glas), but will it do the same like the others? Not fitting all around? Or does this one do completely cover it, without leaving a gap. 

Or do some of you leave it like it is. No screen protector or bezel or bodybumper? ( I didn't choose the thug life, but the thug life choose me). 

Looking forward for a reply, maybe someone can help me with this.

Setup was pretty straightforward after I learned about NumberSync, which AT&amp;T needs in order to sync the watch with the wireless account.

My phone's plan is unlimited data, not sure how much the watch can use but I don't believe I'll use much data when I don't have my phone with me.

When connected to my phone, my watch gets my att.net email and Outlook email just fine. But obviously I lose connectivity to the phone apps when I get out of range of the phone.

Question: Do reminders work offline?,"Hello /r/galaxywatch,

i am playing around with the thought of buying a galaxy watch active2, but there is one question that I cant find a proper answer too. I apologize if this was already asked and I just cant find it.

One feature I will use VERY extensively are the reminders. And I want to make sure these work without a connection to my phone as I often leave it at home. So when I am outsode, can I create an reminder on the watch itself that then reminds me as well? If the reminders sync to the phone that is neat and all but I  very much want it to work without the phone present at all.

If the stock reminder app cant do this, is there an alternative?

Thanks in advance and have a nice day.",0,question reminder work offline hello r galaxywatch playing around thought buying galaxy watch active one question cant find proper answer apologize already asked cant find one feature use extensively reminder want make sure work without connection phone often leave home outsode create reminder watch reminds well reminder sync phone neat much want work without phone present stock reminder app cant alternative thanks advance nice day,435
Watch strap recommendations Galaxy 46mm,"Hi guys.

So the crappy Silicone default strap that came with my galaxy 46mm watch irritated my skin after about a week, I now think I have eczema there! Anyway I bought a nice looking leather strap on Amazon, for it in the UK price was ¬£18.99. And to my dismay I obviously didn't look hard enough because the one I ordered was a bloody leather silicone hybrid so the very part which is on your skin is silicone, annoyed at my incompetence I tried the strap out for a week and yep still get major irritation on my wrist, so that is now in the post having being refunded.

Can anyone recommend or send a link to a strap which doesn't irritate your skin and fits my big wrists? (8inches) I think this is also why I'm getting irritation because it's quite tight. I've never had issues like this with normal watches before.

I'm dubious about going for a metal strap because if it is too small I don't think they send extra links so I will have to send it back again!

Thanks guys.

Ps just a reminder I'm in the UK and my wrist size is 8 inches or around 21cm.",0,watch strap recommendation galaxy mm hi guy crappy silicone default strap came galaxy mm watch irritated skin week think eczema anyway bought nice looking leather strap amazon uk price dismay obviously look hard enough one ordered bloody leather silicone hybrid part skin silicone annoyed incompetence tried strap week yep still get major irritation wrist post refunded anyone recommend send link strap irritate skin fit big wrist inch think also getting irritation quite tight never issue like normal watch dubious going metal strap small think send extra link send back thanks guy p reminder uk wrist size inch around cm,622

3 in 1 charging station for my galaxy watch active 2.,"I currently have a Galaxy Watch Active 2, an Android phone with USB type C but *no* wireless charging as well as a pair airpod pros which *can* charge wirelessly. 

Is there any charging station that can fit my needs? I know it's probably an odd one but i just want to know if there's anything out there.

I need it to charge my phone wired/through a type C dock (1). My airpod pros via either lighting or wireless charging(2). Charge my Galaxy Watch Active 2 without needing the original watch charger(3).

**Edit 1:** i just wanted to make it clear that my current phone is a OnePlus 7, it doesn't offer wireless charging hence the reason why i requested for the phone to be charged like a phone dock, by the looks of things I'm going to have to settle on something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PD43PM3/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_41WKZ62YEMZJCVGNEAY2) ( thanks u/rowdy5757 ) and charge my phone normally

Sleep Tracking,"Through Samsung health and my galaxy watch, my sleep has been tracked without me realizing. Today I found all the data and realized my sleep is apparently horrible? How accurate can I take this information, should I possibly ask my doctor about this? I have nearly none (less than five minutes if any) deep sleep, and maybe an hour of REM, with the rest being light sleep and throughout the night it says I'm only getting around 4 to 5 hours of shitty rest.

Love the HERE app on the Watch!,"I have the app installed on the watch for easy navigation by bike, (works great there, but that's expected) , but yesterday I used the app on the phone to give directions, to find it opened the app on the watch as well, to show just the next turn, that's just a so intuitive way to use it, as the watch is right there, where the steering is! 
I'd love more Apps to integrate the watch so nicely and innovative! This is how it should work!
I mean, I get it, it's complicated, as you see with for example Spotify, but when it works it's just awesome, and in my opinion more apps should at least try!",0,love app watch app installed watch easy navigation bike work great expected yesterday used app phone give direction find opened app watch well show next turn intuitive way use watch right steering love apps integrate watch nicely innovative work mean get complicated see example spotify work awesome opinion apps least try,322

Best fitness app?,"I'm returning to the Android world after 10 years with Apple.  A lot has changed. 

I used to use CardioTrainer, which I see is no longer functional. Which is really sad because it was the best app back when I had my Hero. 

I went through a bunch of fitness apps with Apple and then with the Apple Watch. Nothing worked great between the two. There were synching issues, music playing issues, workout recording issues ... I never found anything I loved that worked well on both the watch and the phone. 

So I'm looking for suggestions. What do you love? What works great between the phone and watch? 

I run, go for long walks with the dogs, ride horses, bike, and do aerobics/weight lifting workouts at home. Something with the ability to cue for intervals would be a huge bonus. 

A free trial would be great but I don't mind paying. Would prefer the one-time fee rather than the subscription setup.

Take a break reminder on Watch3?,"I upgraded from my Active2 Pro to a Watch3. One thing I'm missing is the Active2 Pro would remind me to take a break, stand up and move around. That doesn't seem to be built into the Watch3 unless I'm missing the setting.

Samsung Health and MFP only watch steps?,Hi all. Just got a Galaxy and I'm having a problem syncing steps to MFP in that it's sending all step data. I know how to filter in Samsung Health itself and just show the watch steps but the steps getting sent to MFP are the phone and watch steps combined which is obviously too many. Am I missing something? Have a Pixel 4 if it matters. Sorry if this is the wrong sub just seems to be the closest active one.
