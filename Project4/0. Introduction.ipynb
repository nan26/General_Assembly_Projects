    "West Nile Virus is the **leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States** ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html])). It was first detected in the United States in 1999 and has since quickly spread around the country by the bite of an infected mosquito to humans. Illinois first identified a case on two dead crows carrying the pathogen in September 2001. By the end of 2002, Illinois had encountered more human cases than any other States in the US ([source](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/west-nile-virus)). \n",

    "In about 20% of people infected by the virus, it was reported that they developed fever, headache, vomiting and rash. In less than 1% of people, it affects nervous systems and poses a 10% risk of death ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fwestnile%2Ffaq%2FgenQuestions.html)). \n",

    "\n",
    "In 2004, the City of Chicago and Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a **comprehensive surveillance and control program** to scatter mosquitos trap across the city from late spring through the fall (May to October). The mosquitos trapped then is tested for the presence of West Nile Virus. This data will then be used to help the public health department to determine the location and timing of mosquito spray to curb the adult mosquitos population ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus)).

If proven useful in predicting WNV presence, the information from each type of features will be included by creating additional features to account for it. Subsequently, a few machine learning models are to be trained and compared based on its efficacy to predict presence of WNV according to its AUC score. Finally, the machine learning model will be used to **predict the occurrence of next WNV outbreak**. This insight is used as a baseline to provide a set of **recommendations for CDPH to prevent future outbreaks**. "

    "Our research puts the [cost of pesticide](https://www.fixr.com/costs/mosquito-control) spraying a 10 acre area (or, a flat surface area with a 100 m radius) to be about USD 10,000 with repeat spraying included for a period of 6 months. Humans infected with WNV incur an [average direct treatment cost](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/10/18-1608_article#:~:text=For%2090%20persons%20infected%20with,fever%20(p%3C0.0001)) of USD 8-9,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "One pesticide spray is likely to prevent multiple human infections over a long period (assuming they are effective), and so, we have tentatively placed the cost of a 1 pesticide spray to be 1:20 of that of human treatment (estimating that pesticide sprays help prevent at least 20 infections over a 6 month period).\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, by creating our model, we find how we may keep human treatment to a bare minimum, while reducing pesticide sprays as a second priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a confusion matrix, False Negatives in our context are areas which should have been sprayed but were not because the model predicted that there would be a very low probability of WNV infected mosquitoes there. A False Positive would be a place which had a low probability of having said mosquitoes, but the model predicted that it would have them instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we are aiming to build a model which has the minimum number of False Positives for a given False Negative benchmark (likely 0). Such a model by extension implies a very high ROC-AUC score, or in our specific case, an optimized Specificity-Precision curve."
