It is no wonder the best predictor as this size of the property greatly influences the Saleprice. At number two, Overall Quality of the property takes the spot and is no suprise that it is one of the top predictors in property prices. Next is the property located in Northridge Heights neighborhood.It is no wonder the best predictor as this neighbourhood is very convenient and is the closest to Iowa State University, the largest university in Iowa state and also very close to downtown.
